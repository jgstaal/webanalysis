### Belonging Sessions
We host belonging sessions to foster Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging throughout our company. A belonging session provides a safe space for teammates to have a candid conversation about their experiences and share ideas and recommendations related to diversity, inclusion & belonging. As a grassroots effort, we strive to continuously listen to our teammates and improve our program based on their direct feedback. 
![](https://www.bbinsurance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/icon_box-checked.png)
### Culture Day
Our Culture Day Floating Holiday offers teammates the flexibility to observe any day during the year to recognize their culture or heritage based on their individual preferences. Teammates can also use this floating holiday for community service that allows them to learn about diversity in their community. We believe that this benefit recognizes the diversity and uniqueness of our teammates and promotes inclusion at our company.

### Teammate Resource Groups (TRGs)
At Brown & Brown we have teammates, not employees. One of our ways to bring teammates together is through our TRGs. These are teammate led, voluntary groups, that connect our teammates who share or support a common identity. Our TRGs provide leadership development, networking opportunities, and business solutions. They also support community outreach and philanthropic efforts.

### Heritage & Commemorative Months
As part of our commitment to fostering an inclusive environment and building a diverse workforce, we recognize federally observed Commemorative Months. During these observances teammates from across the company come together to engage with one another to learn about and celebrate what makes each of us unique.

I get a sense of belonging by being allowed to be my authentic self. I’m grateful that the teammates I have worked with at Brown & Brown have accepted me as I am, and I have never felt pressured to act any differently from my true self. To me, teamwork is key to having a successful career. Those who consistently work in a team environment should foster an ability to be an active listener and understand the communication methods their teammates respond to best.

###### Brown & Brown of Massachusetts
I have been able to participate in many different initiatives that have created an incredible community of teammates determined to support one another. I feel comfortable being myself in and outside of work. Belongingness to me means never leaving myself at the door. It means that I can have a sense of community in a space that fosters openness, acceptance and opportunity to celebrate our differences. Brown & Brown’s LGBTQ+ TRG is near and dear to my heart. Since joining the leadership team I have been able to help continue to support the safe space that our teammates value. This group has become a chosen family for me, and many others. I have had the opportunity to meet so many new people that I would not have been previously exposed to and I have learned so much about my community and myself in return.

Brown & Brown provides me the opportunity to embrace and foster a sense of belonging by allowing my teammates and me to have diversity of thought, ideas, and viewpoints. Our opinions matter and are heard; our well-being, development, and growth matter.

I served in the United States Air Force for 6 years and am a disabled veteran who suffers from PTSD relative to my experiences in Desert Shield/Desert Storm. I am a big advocate for PTSD in my community and have presented many times on the subject. I want people to know that it's possible to have a disability and a prosperous life, both personally and professionally.

I am proud to work for a company that supports DIB the way Brown & Brown does and was pleased when the company started its DIB program for all offices.

In tune with Brown & Brown’s “Culture of Caring”, my husband and I try to be involved with our community as much as we can. We support our local LGBTQ Community and try to attend PRIDE celebrations each year. I feel that PRIDE is every day and we should all celebrate who and what we are every day.

###### Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Leader
###### Brown & Brown Insurance
My elementary school’s motto was, and still is, “Everyone is different. Everyone Belongs.” This quote has been a guiding principle and mantra for me since I was 5 years old; it’s something I’m so grateful to have heard so often as a young person. Belonging for me means I can be my unique self in a community with others. I feel a sense of belonging when those around me form intentional connections. Personally, that means asking with the intent to understand and coming together with an open-minded and accepting spirit. 
> "Everyone is different. Everyone Belongs." 
I enjoy the community at Brown & Brown because everyone I've worked with is invested in getting to know me as a person. There's generosity in taking the time to connect, and there is a genuine culture that lends itself to foster belonging and appreciating us for our different experiences. I'm looking forward to putting our DIB strategy into effect by establishing our Teammate Resource Groups as communities where teammates can connect and work together to make our company more inclusive.

To me, belongingness means feeling accepted and comfortable within a community. It’s a fundamental human need. At Brown & Brown, I’ve never felt more at home. A significant part of this is the Teammate Resource Groups. No matter which group I’m involved in, I feel a strong connection with others. We share common goals and ideas while celebrating our unique differences. Working in an organization that prioritizes inclusion and belonging means being surrounded by supportive individuals. It’s inspiring to see how, together, we uplift each other’s morale and engagement. I’ve truly found my community at B&B through the Power of She. This was the first TRG I joined, and I feel fortunate to now hold a leadership position within it. This group has provided me with the opportunity to strengthen relationships and learn from remarkable women leaders throughout the organization. I’ve fully embraced all TRGs, and I am continually amazed by the incredible support from every teammate involved. I feel comfortable and welcomed in every meeting. I’ve also learned the importance of being an ally, and I’m committed to doing my part to make B&B an even more inclusive space for everyone.

## The Brown & Brown Experience
![](https://www.bbinsurance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/wbnb-family-icon.png)
### Health, Family, Business
We encourage a healthy work-life balance for all teammates. Your health and well-being come first, along with the health and well-being of your family. We believe that when we, as an organization, collectively value and support these priorities, our company will continue to be driven by a positive, engaged, and productive team.
![](https://www.bbinsurance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/wbnb-workplace-icon.png)
### Workplace Environment
We offer a positive and collaborative work environment.
Teammates are encouraged to openly discuss any issues with leadership to ensure timely and appropriate resolutions.
With our open-door policy, senior leadership is easily accessible for any of your needs.
![](https://www.bbinsurance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/wbnb-meritocracy-icon.png)
### A Meritocracy
Your tenure at a company should not parallel your reward. We are A Meritocracy, where teammates are rewarded on their performance and achievement of goals. A proactive and entrepreneurial attitude thrives in our environment by having the freedom to pursue opportunities, while having the support of a global organization.
![](https://www.bbinsurance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/wbnb-ownership-icon.png)
### Ownership Mindset
With the financial stability and sustained growth of an industry-leading brokerage, your success depends heavily on your efforts to be the best YOU possible. We strive to provide opportunities for teammates to have ownership in our Company and create personal wealth through participation in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), our 401(k), and long-term equity grants. Remarkably, over 60% of our teammates invest in our Company. 
![](https://www.bbinsurance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/wbnb-built-icon.png)
### Built to Last – A Forever Company
Our Company is rapidly growing on an organic basis and through the acquisition of like-minded companies. Unlike our competitors, we will _never_ be sold.

We are proud to share that Zack Papalia, Senior Population & Well-Being Health Consultant, has been featured in the Employee Benefits News article, “Let’s Move: How to make fitness a part of the workday.”
For the good of a workforce’s holistic health, employers should look for ways to promote more movement into their employees’ workday, offer benefits that fit a broad range of needs and educate them about how a little bit of activity each day can go a long way. There are 10,080 minutes in one week, so all you have to do is facilitate or help [people] find 1.4% of their time [and] just have fun moving. It doesn’t have to be a workout class, a spin class, or heavy weightlifting; just any movement for 1% of your week, and suddenly you have a clinically significant impact on your long-term health and well-being, says Papalia.

We are proud to share that our Chief People Officer, Julie Turpin, has published her latest article as a Fast Company Executive Board contributor.
In her new piece, “How treating employee resource groups (ERGs) like business units builds better leaders,” Julie explores how TRGs can accelerate leadership development, foster diverse perspectives and align with broader business strategies.
“When strategically integrated into the business framework, employee resource groups can provide a strong platform for developing critical leadership skills. With the right support and structure, these groups can lead to long-term success for a company’s workforce, culture, and business growth.”

What are the Great Place To Work evaluation criteria?
Great Place To Work Certification criteria are the global standard for quantifying and benchmarking the employee experience. Using the [Great Place To Work Trust Model and the Trust Index Survey](https://www.greatplacetowork.com/certified-company/</our-methodology>), Certification evaluates workplace culture from the perspective that matters the most — the employee — offering the most comprehensive picture on the market of the internal health of an organization.
To be considered for Certification, organizations must have 10 or more employees and must complete a two-step process: 
  1. Survey employees with the Trust Index Survey.
  2. Complete the Culture Brief™, a company questionnaire. 


Positive employee responses to the Trust Index Survey (four and above on the five-point scale) are averaged to provide an organization-wide assessment of culture: the Trust Index. Companies that score above the current threshold become Great Place To Work Certified.
Surveys must meet strict requirements for how they are distributed and the percentage of employees who respond to ensure they accurately represent feedback from the company’s full population. 
How do we know if we earned Certification?
To earn Great Place To Work Certification, the average score across your survey results must show that approximately 7 out of 10 of your employees are having a consistently positive experience at work.
Once you are Certified, you will receive an email from us with access to your survey scores, digital Certification badge, a toolkit of social media images, and press materials with shareable content. As an extra benefit, your organization will automatically be eligible for all our award lists through the entire 12-month period your Certification is valid.
How many questions are on the employee survey?
Employees answer 14 demographic questions and respond to 60 statements across a five-point consistency scale as well as two open-ended questions. Employees generally take 10 to 20 minutes to complete the survey. 
What is the Great Place To Work survey measuring?
In broad terms, the Great Place To Work Trust Index™ Survey measures the level of trust in your organization and the consistency of the employee experience. In other words: How often can employees count on something happening in their workplace, such as clear and honest leadership, fair treatment, and employee recognition?
More specifically, the Great Place To Work Trust Index Survey measures individual employee experiences of five dimensions of a high-trust company culture through 60 statements and two open-ended questions. Three of the dimensions are connected to the actions of leaders and building trust: credibility, respect, and fairness. The other two dimensions measure the workplace experience of employees in relation to their colleagues and the wider organization: pride and a sense of belonging.
These five dimensions create a workplace culture where employees feel empowered and encouraged to do their most meaningful work. High-trust cultures are shown in Great Place To Work research to [outperform their competitors](https://www.greatplacetowork.com/certified-company/</resources/blog/5-ways-workplace-culture-drives-business-profitability>) in recruitment and retention, productivity and innovation, and financial performance. 
Survey answers are assessed on a five-point scale, revealing the most common experience of employees in the organization. Employee scores are averaged to provide an organization-wide assessment of workplace culture: the Trust Index score.
